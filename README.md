# Skin Cancer Prediction Model

Overview
This repository houses a skin cancer prediction model trained on a massive dataset of over 4,00,000 entries and their corresponding high-resolution images. The primary goal of this project is to develop a highly accurate and robust deep learning model to assist in the early detection and classification of various types of skin lesions, thereby supporting medical professionals in their diagnostic process.

Dataset
The model was trained on a comprehensive dataset comprising approximately 400,000 images of skin lesions. Each entry includes:

Images dataset :- Individual image corresponding to the ISIC_ID
Metadata:- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jk9W9s0RRX3H42afKa6vDhy7ejoaPH0l-M-atpV0zL0/edit?usp=sharing

The dataset has been meticulously cleaned, preprocessed, and augmented to ensure high quality and to mitigate potential biases.
